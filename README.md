# üõí Smart Grocery List - A React Native App

Welcome to the Smart Grocery List app! This is a modern, feature-rich mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to make your grocery shopping experience smarter and more enjoyable.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd grocery-list
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Your API Key

This app uses the Groq API for recipe generation.

1. Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`.
2. Inside `.env` file, add your Groq API key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YourActualApiKeyHere

```

3. _Important_: The `.env` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to ensure your key is never commited to the repository.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Expo development server. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to see the app in action.

```
npm start
```

### File Structure

This project is organized with a clean and scalable structure:

- `App.tex`: The main entry point and primary screen of the application.
- `App.config.js`: The Expo configuration file, which securely loads the API key.
- `/src/components`: Contains reusable UI components like `ShoppingListItem.tsx` and the `icons.tsx` file.
- `/src/services`: Contains the business logic for interacting with external services, such as `aiService.ts` and `notificationService.ts`.

### Future Enhancements

- _Multiple Lists_: Allow users to create and manage different lists (e.g., "Weekly Groceries", "Party Supplies").
- _Item Categories_: Automatically categorize items (e.g.,"Dairy", "Produce") for more organized shopping.
- _Shared Lists_: Implement a backend to allow users to share and collaborate on lists in real-time.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for a smarter shopping trip.
